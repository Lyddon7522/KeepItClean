# Getting Started

## Compiling CSS

The web project uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for its styling, utilizing their Tailwind CLI in order to compile a stylesheet. In order to run the CLI, do the following:

- Open a terminal
- Navigate to the `tailwindcss.exe` executable.
- Run `./tailwindcss -i ./wwwroot/css/app.css -o ./wwwroot/css/tailwind.css --watch`

TODO: Set this up in a workflow, including `--minify`
